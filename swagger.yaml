  description: "Milla is mostly Qt Jira-specific orchestrator service for the OpenReq Qt trial that operates between Qt Jira and the OpenReq infrastructure. Milla has five main functionalities divided into three different controllers. <br>\r\n<b>Milla controller:</b><br>1) Milla fetches all or updated data from Qt Jira and stores in a caching manner the data in the Mallikas database service.  <br>\r\n2) Milla orchestrates the communication to Mallikas database service so that a project, requirement etc. can be manipulated (CRUD manner) in Mallikas database service in OpenReq JSON format. <br>\r\n3) Milla orchestrates the data from Mallikas database service to Mulperi service in order to manage dependencies, carry out analyses etc.  <br>\r\n<b>Detection controller:</b><br>4) Milla calls the natural language processing services of OpenReq infrastructre that can detect from the requirements text hidden or implicit dependencies to other requirements.  <br>\r\n<b>Qt controller:</b><br>5) Milla provides the access point for the Qt Jira dependency browser in the Qt trial. <br>\r\n"
